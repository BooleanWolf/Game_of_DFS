# Game_of_DFS

You need to click on the nodes of a path which will add up to the maximum sum till you reach the destination

** Basically implementation of DFS  **

- You can RESET if you think you made a mistake
- You can RELOAD. (Random number will be generated)
- You can only advance to node that are connected to the one you are on. 
- You can see the SOLVE. (It will show you the answer.)
